# 5G Technologies

## From 3G to 6G

The 5G technologies module was composed of 6 classes. During the first two ones, we were given an overview of the evolution of telecommunications from the beginning of them until today, and some perspectives about the future.

We mentioned the electronic market and the big companies running it, the two big telecom crashes of 2000 and 2008, the evolution of all generations, the 3GPP impact, some examples of local company cases and the future including 6G and the AI dominance.

## Inverted classes

During the 4 last classes, we made 15 minute presentations in pairs over topics related to 5G and 6G (use case, danger, future perspectives, …).I will present below the topic I worked on and a few information of what I noted for each other topic.

### V2V

I worked on the topic of Vehicule to Vehicule(V2V). You can find the presentation here.

Vehicule to Vehicule present the technologies used to communicate directly between vehicles on the road. Better energy consumption, more fluid traffic, collision avoidance are some of the motivations for those technologies.

Even if DSRC, the first solution to exist since 1999, was deployed, 3GPP will propose an alternative in 2017, C-V2X including V2V, witch is now mostly used.

### 6G Modulation

To increase the performance of communication( decrease latency, increase average, ...), the 6G characterization propose diverse solutions:

* the use of new band: 7 to 15 GHz for the public and 50 to 300 GHz for the industry
* the use of probabilistic shaping for constellation: make sure that the most used bit are in the center
* the use of new modulations: up to 4096 in some static case
* the reuse of some 5G waveforms: DFT-OFDM for uplink and CP-OFDM for downlink

### Millimetric Waves

Millimetric waves refers to the band 30 to 300 GHz. This are already used (in 5G, medical use or sensor for example) but 6G might increase their usage and a part of the scientific community is concerned by their effect, especially on the human body:

* thermic effects seems to be located only on the surface of the skin and therefore not dangerous
* non thermic effects lacks research and might cause VGCC
* there is also a possible issue due to the bad propagation of those waves, necessitating beamforming that will concentrate those effects

### ITU view of 6G

ITU is the Telecommunication part of the United Nations. They organize meetings named WRC every 2/3 years to publish RR.

The IMT-2030 defines the timeline of the 6G project:

* In 2023 the framework was defined
* In 2026 the Requirements will be explicited
* In 2030 the Evaluation phase will start and the the deployment
  
Some of the 6G tendencies are AI, Health, Industry, Energy consumption, augmented reality, ...

### Electromagnetic Waves and Cancer

Electromagnetic waves are magnetic and electric oscillations that move around in space.

Similarly to what was said about millimetric waves, as the industry focuses on the proven study that thermic effects aren't a threat, the research still warns about the possible dangers of non thermic effects and the lack of research about it.

### Mobile Health

Mobile health is a term that englobes all telecommunication usage applied to medical cases.
Teleconsultation, IoT sensors as audio aids, wearqbles as smart watches or even medical apps.

Some 5G advancement can be useful to improve those products, for example slicing that allows a lower latency and a better debit. They also can help reduce cyber attacks risk and help a better acceptance from the public.

### 2G Shutdown

Since the start of mobile telecommunication in the 90s, standards have quickly evolved. To free bands to prepare the deployment of the 6G, prevent security issues of older technologies, reduce energy consumption or face the lack of new replacement components, the shutdown of 2G and 3G was decided and already started.

This leads to some issues that need to be addressed quickly to avoid bigger problems. Here are some examples:

* With phones, as they need to be compatible with at least 4G to still be used
* With elevator, as many energy system works in 2G and needs to be immediately replaced
* With cars, as some alert systems and GPS will also need to be updated

### Satellites constellations

A constellation is a network of satellites with a shared function. Many of them have been deployed through the years in the different orbits above earth. Some examples are IRIDIUM, GLOBALSTAR, STARLINK, ONEWEB or EUTELSAT.
  
The release 17 of 3GPP defining 5G-NTN, includes the objective of using those satellites constellations for 5G (and 6G) communication.

## Analysis

I found this course particularly interesting. The inverted class format was particularly adapted for this class, which was more of a general knowledge class. The only thing we lacked was feedback at the end of our presentations.

I was already familiar with the basic information of 5G due to research work that we made last year in Telecom class. To complete the analysis of an article about 5G, I did some research on the 3GPP website and read other papers. I apprecited that we had the chance to choose the topic of our presentation.

I chose V2V because I am interested in the automotive usage of 5G. It was coherent with the company I did my internship in last summer, as they are a member of the company alliance that reflect and work on applying V2V solutions.

I now confidently can say that I know where to search for informations on mobile networks technologies.
