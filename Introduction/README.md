# Introduction

## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Amalia Magana, a computer science student in 5th year at INSA. I enter the school in first year in september 2019 and after a long journey with two extra years I finally arrive at the end of my scholar years.

I am a very creative person with imagination who outside of a school context crafts a lot. When I entered INSA, I never had touch a line of code in my life. I was just interested in science, needing some logic, coherence and structure to find peace in my work.

When I discoverd the Algorithmic classes, I found in them all of those aspects, and I had fun coding. I still wanted to became a Mathematics Engineer at that moment, but through time, computer science seemed just like the wright career and I finally decided to embrace it.

## Why choosing ISS?

In 3rd year, I discoverd network and telecom into classes and i really appreciate it. Its actually what made me sure that I wanted to peruse a career in computer science. In 4th year, I choose the communicating system minor despite not knowing anybody who was in it because I considered this was the most interesting part of computer science.

All of those discovery and choices logically pushed me into 5 ISS. The "working on each layer" aspect was intriguing and I appreciated the competence approach. I will make an analysis at the end in the Portfolio folder.

## Why this portfolio?

This document is the result of 4 month of works, in class and at home, to discover what I learn and more globally what happen during this semester. It will be a recap of all the classes I followed, what interest did I find in them and which competences I gain in each one of them.

To display this, I chose a simple format of a git page. I do not really appreciate very long documents as I do not find them easy to navigate to, and I think they miss structure. I didn't had the time to develop a website (and frontend development isn't a field that got me the most interested) or learn how to use another interface so this seems the best solution.
